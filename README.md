# Hash Code: Team bayes and co

This is our team's solution to the  [Google Hash code 2017](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/), which ranked among the top 25% of contestants and was unfortunately not enough for us to qualify. However, we had a blast and we believe it might be useful to share how we progressed in the 4h-contest, as can be emphasized by the commit log.

## Our team

We are 4 [ENSAE](http://www.ensae.fr/ensae/fr/) students and this was our first programming contest, so we are quite happy with our result. We'll probably participate next year and hope to do even better! 

## Challenge solution:

The solution when the challenge ended can be found in the *sub_finale* folder.
The other python files might evolve as we try to improve our solution.
